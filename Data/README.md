## CVS File
Our CSV file compiles data on a wide range of movies, including their budgets, release dates, domestic and international box office earnings, and ratings from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic and much more. It combines financial metrics with critical and audience scores to allow analysis of how different factors influence box office performance. This dataset supports comparisons between highly rated films and their commercial success across various markets.



## Jupyter Notebook
Our Jupyter notebook analyzes the relationship between movie ratings and box office performance using data from multiple sources. It includes data cleaning, exploratory visualizations, and regression models to evaluate whether higher ratings predict greater revenue and many other analysis questions. The notebook aims to uncover key factors that influence a filmâ€™s commercial success beyond just critical acclaim.
