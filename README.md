## Purpose of Project
The main point of this project is to investigate whether critically acclaimed and highly rated movies actually perform better at the box office compared to average-rated, widely promoted films. It aims to explore the relationship between digital ratings from platforms like IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic and a film’s financial success, uncovering whether ratings are reliable indicators or if other factors—like marketing and budget—play a more significant role.
