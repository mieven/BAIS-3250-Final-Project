## Purpose of Project
The main point of this project is to investigate whether critically acclaimed and highly rated movies actually perform better at the box office compared to average-rated, widely promoted films. It aims to explore the relationship between digital ratings from platforms like IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic and a film’s financial success, uncovering whether ratings are reliable indicators or if other factors—like marketing and budget—play a more significant role.

## CVS File
Our CSV file compiles data on a wide range of movies, including their budgets, release dates, domestic and international box office earnings, and ratings from IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic and much more. It combines financial metrics with critical and audience scores to allow analysis of how different factors influence box office performance. This dataset supports comparisons between highly rated films and their commercial success across various markets.

## Jupyter Notebook
Our Jupyter notebook analyzes the relationship between movie ratings and box office performance using data from multiple sources. It includes data cleaning, exploratory visualizations, and regression models to evaluate whether higher ratings predict greater revenue and many other analysis questions. The notebook aims to uncover key factors that influence a film’s commercial success beyond just critical acclaim.

## Data Dictionary
The data dictionary provides a comprehensive view of movies by combining financial data—such as budget, domestic gross, and worldwide earnings—with critic and audience ratings from major platforms like Rotten Tomatoes, IMDb, and Metacritic. It also includes descriptive details such as genre, runtime, studio, director, and awards, offering rich context for analysis. This allows for in-depth exploration of how different factors influence a movie’s critical reception and commercial success.
